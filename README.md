# **Credit Card Spend Analysis & Forecasting**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
Credit card transactions generate vast amounts of data, providing valuable insights into customer spending patterns. This project analyzes customer spending behavior based on transaction categories (e.g., food, travel, shopping) and builds a time-series forecasting model using **Facebook Prophet** to predict future spending trends.  

The final model is deployed as a **Streamlit web app**, allowing users to input parameters and get spending forecasts.

## **📂 Dataset Description**  

### **📌 Data Source:**  
- Public datasets from **Kaggle/UCI Machine Learning Repository**
- Synthetic data generated using **Faker, NumPy, Pandas**  

### **📝 Features in the Dataset:**  
| Column Name         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `Transaction_ID`   | Unique identifier for each transaction |
| `Customer_ID`      | Unique ID for each customer |
| `Transaction_Date` | Date of the transaction |
| `Transaction_Amount` | Amount spent in each transaction |
| `Category`         | Spending category (Food, Travel, Shopping, etc.) |
| `Merchant`         | Name of the merchant/store |
| `Payment_Method`   | Mode of payment (Credit, Debit, Online, POS) |
| `Location`         | City or country of transaction |
| `Balance_After_Transaction` | Remaining balance after transaction |

### **🎯 Target Variable:**  
- **Transaction_Amount** (Used for predicting future spending patterns)

## **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

### **✅ Basic EDA Questions**  
1. What are the **top spending categories** by transaction volume and amount?  
2. How does spending vary **over time** (daily, weekly, monthly trends)?  
3. What are the **peak spending hours** in a day?  
4. What is the **most common payment method** used?  
5. Which merchants have the **highest transactions**?  

### **📊 Intermediate-Level Analysis**  
1. Are there **seasonal trends** in spending across different categories?  
2. How do different **customer segments** (high spenders vs. low spenders) behave?  
3. What is the **distribution of transaction amounts** (histogram, boxplot analysis)?  
4. Are there any **correlations between spending behavior and location**?  
5. How does **spending behavior change before and after payday**?  

### **🚀 Advanced-Level Analysis**  
1. Can we **detect outliers** in spending behavior using anomaly detection?  
2. Are there **clusters of customers** based on spending habits? (**K-Means, DBSCAN**)  
3. Can we use **association rule mining** (**Apriori, FP-Growth**) to find purchase patterns?  
4. How does spending behavior **correlate with economic factors** (inflation, interest rates)?  
5. Can we use **NLP on transaction descriptions** to classify transactions more effectively?

## **🧠 Machine Learning Model – Facebook Prophet**  

### **📌 Model Selection:**  
We use **Facebook Prophet**, a powerful time-series forecasting tool designed for financial and business data.  

### **🔬 Steps to Build the Model:**  
1. **Prepare Data**  
   - Convert `Transaction_Date` to a time-series format.  
   - Aggregate transactions **by day/month** for each spending category.  

2. **Train Model**  
   - Use `Transaction_Amount` as the target variable.  
   - Include **external regressors** (holiday effects, economic factors).  

3. **Evaluate Model Performance**  
   - **Metrics Used:**  
     - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
     - **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**  
   - Compare Prophet’s **forecast with actual data**.

## **🖥️ Deployment – Streamlit Web App**  

### **🎯 Features of the Web App:**  
✔ **User Input Panel** – Select customer ID, spending category, and time range.  
✔ **Interactive Data Visualization** – View historical spending trends with graphs.  
✔ **Future Forecasting** – Predict spending trends for the next **3-6 months**.  

---

## **📈 Results & Insights**  

🔹 **Top spending categories** include **Food, Shopping, and Travel**.  
🔹 Customers **spend more on weekends** and during **holidays**.  
🔹 **Peak transaction hours** are between **12 PM – 6 PM**.  
🔹 Spending is **higher after payday** than before.  
🔹 The model predicts future spending trends with an **R² score of ~85%**.
